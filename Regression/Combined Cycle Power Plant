Introduction:
  This pet project is to understand all the regression models and also to learn how to evaluate them and choose the best model out of available regression models

Dataset source:
  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/294/combined+cycle+power+plant

Data Description:
  The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. 
  Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP)  of the plant.

Regression Models:
1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Support Vector Regression
4. Decition Tree Regression
5. Random Forest Regression

Comparison Metrics Used to compare best regression model : R-Squared

Out of all models :
Random Forest Regression acheives the highest R-square value and stands out as the best model for predicting the net hourly electrical energy output (EP)  of the plant
